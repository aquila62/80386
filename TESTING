Test a Linear Feedback Shift Register by running lfsr15.
This program cycles through a 15-bit LFSR.  The period length
is printed at the end.  Output bits are not printed.

Usage:

lfsr15

---------------------------------------------------------------

Test the Sieve of Eratosthenes by running sv.  Prime numbers
are generated up to 268435399.  Only primes from 268427279
to 268435399 are printed, to save space.

Usage:

sv

---------------------------------------------------------------

Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle by running twr.  A recursive
algorithm is used.  See the Wikipedia article on the Tower of
Hanoi for information on the algorithm.

Usage:

twr #disks

Where #disks is 2 to 9.

The program prints the state of the three towers after each move.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Perform a cyclical reduncancy check by running crc.  This
program produces a 32 bit hash of input data read from stdin.

Usage:

cat myfile | crc
echo "text" | crc

The output is a 32 bit hexadecimal number.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Generate a random bit stream by running etausgen.  This program 
creates an endless stream of ASCII zeros and ones.  Press CTL-Z
to stop the program.  The randomizing algorithm used is called
etaus, meaning extended TAUS.  See the etaus repository for more
information on this algorithm.  The initial state for this program
is based on the UNIX date and time in seconds since the epoch.

Usage:

etausgen

---------------------------------------------------------------

Generate a random data stream by running etausraw.  This program 
creates an endless stream of binary data.  Press CTL-Z to stop
the program.  The randomizing algorithm used is called etaus,
meaning extended TAUS.  See the etaus repository for more
information on this algorithm.  The initial state for this program
is based on the UNIX date and time in seconds since the epoch.

This program has been tested successfully with the dieharder
suite of randomness tests.

Usage:

etausraw

etausraw | dieharder -a -g 200

---------------------------------------------------------------

Run lmt to limit a data stream or bit stream to 16 megabytes
of data.  It reads 16 megabytes from stdin and writes them
to stdout.

Usage:

lmt

etausraw | lmt | crc

---------------------------------------------------------------

Display your parameter list and your environment variables
by running getprm.

Usage:

getprm x y z
